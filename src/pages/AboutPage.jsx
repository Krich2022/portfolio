            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm currently enrolled in the University of
            Utah's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I'm diving deep
            into the world of web development. With a year of programming under
            my belt, I've been working extensively with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. One of the exciting projects I've been involved in is
            the development of a website for Bakston Freight Inc. This hands-on
            experience has not only strengthened my technical skills but also
            given me valuable insights into real-world web development. While
            I'm relatively new to programming, I'm dedicated to continuous
            improvement and embracing fresh challenges. Feel free to explore my
            past work, and you can connect with me through the social links
            below.
